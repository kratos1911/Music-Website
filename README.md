# Music-Website
This is my first web dev based project which is based on the 4 fundamentals of web 
This is apparently my first project from 3rd semester which is done using HTML,CSS,JS and PHP/SQL
The project was to develop a music player which has the option to explore music of different genres and different artists.
Users can search up for their favourite album or film song which they wanna listen
Also they have the ability to download any song they listen to , hasslefree
